### Parsing

- Lexical Analysis.  Lexer/tokenizer break source code into valid tokens.
- Syntax Analysis. Parser construct the AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) from tokens according to the language syntax rules.

>With Ignition, V8 compiles JavaScript functions to a concise bytecode, which is between 50% to 25% the size of the equivalent baseline machine code. This bytecode is then executed by a high-performance interpreter which yields execution speeds on real-world websites close to those of code generated by V8â€™s existing baseline compiler.
